Generate a full Lebanese trip plan in pure JSON format.

User Preferences:
- Location: {location}
- Days: {totalDays}
- Travelers: {traveler}
- Budget: {budget}

MANDATORY:
1. Your output MUST contain BOTH:
   - "Hotels" (at least 2 hotels)
   - "Itinerary" (one detailed plan PER DAY with 4-6 real activities each)
2. DO NOT respond with Hotels only. 
   - If you cannot generate full Hotels + Itinerary, return this exact JSON instead:
{ "error": "Unable to complete itinerary. Request clarification or expand search radius." }
3. No fictional places. Use real Lebanese locations validated from:
   - OpenStreetMap Lebanon
   - Google Maps Lebanon
4. Each activity must be within 15km of {location}.
   - You may expand to 30km ONLY if needed, but state this in "notes".
4.1 Activity Variety Rule:
   - Do NOT include two activities of the same category on the same day.
     (e.g., no two museums, no two religious sites, no two hikes on the same day).
   - Ensure variety in pacing: mix cultural, food, nature, and leisure.
   - Include 1 relaxing or scenic activity as the last activity of the day (e.g., sunset view, caf√©, walk by the sea).
4.2 Priority Logic:
   - Prioritize iconic or highly-rated landmarks on Day 1.
   - Reserve hidden gems or low-tourism spots for later days.
5. Respect Budget:
   - Budget ‚ûî $20‚Äì40/day
   - Moderate ‚ûî $40‚Äì80/day
   - Luxury ‚ûî $80‚Äì150/day

   - Couple ‚ûî Romantic, cozy, seaside
   - Family ‚ûî Kid-friendly parks, museums
   - Solo ‚ûî Culture, peaceful, adventurous
   - Friends ‚ûî Nightlife, active group events
